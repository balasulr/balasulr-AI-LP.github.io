### [AI and Emerging Technologies]

**What emerging technology did you choose? How is AI being used to support this technology?:**
- The emerging technology that I chose is Virtual Reality (VR)
- Some ways that AI is used to support VR are:
    - Adapting Virtual Environments: AI algorithms and machine learning analyze user behavior to adapt virtual environments in real time. This includes adjusting the difficulty level and adding new elements to tailor to the userâ€™s preferences
    - Having Dynamic and Evolving Environments: AI helps to create VR environments to help alleviate the time-consuming and resource-intensive process. This ensures users have immersive and responsive experiences

**How does the use of AI and this technology affect everyday life?:**
- Bringing AI into VR helps to elevate what each is capable of to a higher level. AI brings intelligence to VR, which makes the environment not only immersive, but also adaptive to what the user wants
- The gaming industry is adopting AI along with VR to create more immersive and interactive experiences. Characters can react and behave realistically to events in a game. Also, AI can generate content such as game maps, characters and game levels
- In healthcare, AI and VR are being used for many applications. They can be used for surgical training, patient rehabilitation and therapy. For example, VR simulations enhanced by AI can assist surgeons with realistic training environments that allow them to practice complex procedures without having any risk to patients
- In addition, AI and VR can be used in Retail, Real Estate as well as Education and Training

**Are there any concerns with using AI for this application?:**
- There are concerns and challenges that must be addressed with using AI and VR
- There is a need to have seamless integration between the two, which needs sophisticated algorithms, high processing power, and advanced hardware. This helps ensure the VR environment can respond in real time
- There are data and privacy concerns with vast amounts of user data being collected and analyzed to enhance experience and interaction. This leads to concerns around data privacy and security, with developers and companies ensuring user data is protected and not misused
- Prolonged exposure to VR environments can have potential health impacts. When combined with AI, these experiences can become more intense, which necessitates the need for safety protocols and usage guidelines
- The ethical use of AI needs to be examined to ensure that there is a fine line between what can and cannot be done
